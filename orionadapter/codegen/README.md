Adapter Code Generation
-----------------------
> ...or say hi to maintenance headaches.

The `oriondata` dir contains the adapter template definition whereas
`config` contains, wait for it, the definition for adapter configuration.
The `*.proto` files are the only source files in there, all the others
get generated by `scripts/codegen.sh`.

Changing package names or moving files around can be tricky. If you
really (do ya really?!) have to change stuff, keep in mind:

* `scripts/codegen.sh` needs to know where the files are as well as
   the adapter template name;
* the template name gets set to the name of the dir containing the
  `*.proto` file during code generation---see `bin/mixer_codegen.sh`
   in the Istio repo;
* Go code will have to be adjusted accordingly;
* Code generation and deployment go hand in hand: don't forget to
  redeploy **both** the Go binary and the **latest** resource defs,
  i.e. YAML and HTML files;
* some manual clean up may be needed to get rid of previously generated
  files to avoid deploying old resource defs;
* also some of our scripts (`scripts` dir) may need updating.

Godspeed!
