Development Environment
-----------------------

* git
* go >= 1.13
* add $GOPATH/bin (usually ~/go/bin) to your $PATH
* minikube >= 1.5
* kubectl >= 1.7
* docker

**Note**. *Local repo location*. I'm going to assume you've cloned this
repo in `$GOPATH/src/orchestracities/boost`, i.e. you're sticking to Go's
customary layout rules.
