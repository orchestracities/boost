Adapter and mock DAPS images
----------------------------

Let's "Dockerise" our adapter so we can run it on the freshly minted Istio
mesh. And as we're at it, we'll also build a Docker image for the mock
DAPS service we used earlier. We've got a script, `make-images.sh`, to
build them images and a nifty bit of sleight of hand will make Minikube
use them. In a new terminal:

    $ cd $GOPATH/src/orchestracities/boost/
    $ eval $(minikube docker-env)
    $ sh scripts/make-images.sh
    $ exit

The above basically stashes away our images in Minikube's own local Docker
registry so they can be fetched from there instead of trekking all
the way to DockerHub. This article explains how the trick works:
