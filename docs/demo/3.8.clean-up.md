Cleaning up
-----------

**TODO**

    $ kubectl delete gateway httpbin-gateway
    $ kubectl delete virtualservice httpbin
    $ kubectl delete service httpbin
    $ kubectl delete deployment httpbin
    $ ...

or simply:

    $ minikube delete

if you have plenty of time in your hands and don't mind the schlep to
redo everything from a clean slate!
