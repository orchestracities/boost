Deploying Istio
---------------

After installing Minikube, download the Istio release and install the demo
profile. Here's the short version, assuming you've already installed Minikube:

    $ cd ~

    # Start Minikube.

    $ minikube start --memory=16384 --cpus=4
    # Try --memory=4096 if you don't have that much RAM, it worked for us :-)
    $ kubectl config use-context minikube

    # Download and install Istio 1.4.2.

    $ export ISTIO_VERSION=1.4.2
    $ curl -L https://istio.io/downloadIstio | sh -
    $ cd istio-*
    $ export PATH="${PWD}/bin:${PATH}"
    # ...ideally you should add the above to your Bash profile.
    $ istioctl manifest apply --set profile=demo
    $ kubectl -n istio-system edit cm istio
    # ...set disablePolicyChecks to false ("i" for insert mode, "ESC" ":wq" for save & exit)
    $ kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled

**Note**. *Istio version*. Version `1.4.2` is the safest to use since
we've compiled and tested the adapter's gRPC interface against this
version. We also tested extensively with version `1.4.0` and `1.4.3`.
In principle what's documented in this README should work with any
`1.4.*` version and, barring minor adjustments, with `1.5.*` too.

**Note**. *Policy Enforcement*. The docs say the `demo` profile should enable
it (i.e. set `disablePolicyChecks` to `false`) but it doesn't nor does it
work to specify that option at installation time which is why you'll have
to manually edit the K8s config after applying the Istio `demo` profile.

**Tip**. *Istio Dashboard*. If you're looking for an easy way to see
what's going on in your mesh (services, logs, config, etc.), why not
use the Kiali dashboard installed with the demo profile? Try

    $ istioctl dashboard kiali

Log in with user `admin` and password `admin`.
